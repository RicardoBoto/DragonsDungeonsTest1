# DragonsDungeonsTest1

Project made with UE 5.4

To run the tool just need to run the editor tool named CharacterEditorTool on the root of the content.

All other created content is inside Content/DragonsAndDungeonsContent.

Created C++ files:

	DDCharacter
	DiceLibrary
	CharacterEditorTool
	EditorToolCharacterStats


I did not complete the export/import functionality because, I think, it may take more time than the 2-day limit. 
I have a couple of ideas like using the Package serialization system or even the save system to load/unload objects. Another option is to create my xml like file or even use json writers/readers.

I will try to keep at it but in the meantime I would like to make this first delivery
